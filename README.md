# ChatExchange
Kotlin API for StackExchange chat

There is a very basic set up in Test.kt that joins the sandbox room and attached event listeners.

This can be used for testing purposes, but requires a file `credentials.properties` to be present in the root with format:

    email=<email>
    password=<password>
    
Enter the credentials for the account you are using to connect to chat.
